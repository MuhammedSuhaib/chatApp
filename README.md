 list of what I've done so far:

1. Initialized Firebase

Linked with your project

Added Firestore, hosting, and index config

2. Set up Next.js app with:

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

App directory

3. Installed & configured next-themes

Wrapped app in ThemeProvider

Enabled system/light/dark mode

4. Set up custom design tokens using shadcn-style CSS variables

Defined --background, --foreground, etc. for both light & dark

Used @layer base to apply them via Tailwind

5. Customized dark mode

Tweaked background to #121212

Verified dark mode text visibility

6. Understood design tokens like card, popover for UI layering
